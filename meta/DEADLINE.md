## Part 1.1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

The ApiApp that I have created was designed to allow users to increase
their engagement with religious text via modern techonology. This app allows
users to easily retreieve and translate Bible verses into multiple languages.
Also, multiple versions (KJV, ASV, and WEB) were provided so it may be easier
for the user to understand the texts.

## Part 1.2: APIs

> For each RESTful JSON API that your app uses (at least two are required),
> include an example URL for a typical request made by your app. If you
> need to include additional notes (e.g., regarding API keys or rate
> limits), then you can do that below the URL/URI. Placeholders for this
> information are provided below. If your app uses more than two RESTful
> JSON APIs, then include them with similar formatting.

### API 1

```
https://libretranslate.com/
```

> Allows users to translate texts into a variety of languages.

### API 2

```
https://bible-api.com/
```

> Allows users to retrieve bible verses and pick different versions.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

This project has allowed me to learn many things and become more
comfortable in the foundatons of Java. Essentially it is tying
together everything we have learned into one project. I think a few
skills that this project has allowed me to develop were JavaFX, handling
exceptions, and understanding the process of requesting and
via clients and APIs. JavaFX was a little hard to understand at first
and I found my self struggling on the earlier HW assignments
, but now I am more comfortable with the frontend portion of
coding. This project definitely required some patience with
exceptions. I constantly needed to adjust my try catch statements
in order to properly handle all the exceptions. I understood the
process of requesting, but actually formatting it and then making
it work was difficult.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start the project from scratch then I would keep better
track of variables and minimize code to make everything more efficient.
Sometimes I would make something and not use it or make multiple
of the same variables. It makes it easier on me, but for someone
reading the code it can be a little difficult and make the program
run slower.
